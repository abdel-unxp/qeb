first use:

1) from main directory, create empty disk
./scripts/create_disk.sh
2) create rootfs inside this disk
./scripts/create_rootfs.sh
3) build a default kernel for qemu
./script/build_kernel
4) be sure that ./mnt is empty (ie: hdd.img is unmounted
because you dont want qemu to write to hdd.img while
the host is also writting to it.
4) start qemu
./script/start_qemu.sh
